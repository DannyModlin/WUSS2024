Customizing SAS Studio in SAS Viya - The Next Step

SAS has always been there for users to assist with organizing and developing of code. This hands-on workshop discusses the next tool for such assistance in statistical analysis, the custom step. Custom steps enable you to create a user interface for a specific task or analysis. Add your custom steps to a SAS Studio flow to streamline and automate your statistical analysis! In this workshop, you review custom SAS Studio tasks, make connections between this and the creation of custom steps, and then learn to create your own statistical custom step in the SAS Studio Designer.

How to Modify SAS 9 Programs to Run in Viya

How can existing SAS®9 programs can be modified to execute in SAS Viya. Code can either run as is on the SAS Compute Server, or it can be modernized to process data in memory and in parallel on the SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) server. This presentation is perfect for programmers who are new to SAS Viya and want to continue performing their statistical analyses there. We will address questions that are typically asked.
1. Will existing SAS®9 code work in Viya?
2. How must my programs change to take advantage of the new features in Viya?


PROC BGLIMM The Smooth Transition to Bayesian Analytics

Many analysts are interested in taking models they currently have and transitioning them to the Bayesian realm. Most leap from their favorite classical analysis procedure directly to PROC MCMC, the general-purpose Bayesian procedure. This presentation will feature the BGLIMM procedure available since SAS/STAT 15.1. This will allow the participant to model non-normal responses and include random effects within their Bayesian approach. Discussion will include options of priors and availability of statements. Examples will include models originally written in PROCs REG, GLM, GLMSELECT, GENMOD, MIXED, and GLIMMIX.
